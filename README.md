Hiya! Munsterbunny here.

  This is a work in progress that i am producing for the company i work for as a side gig.
  It is not ment to be scaleable nor is it being done fore compensation other than a backpack and a laptop.
  Eventually i want to transfer what i learn here into an SQL based application and try to scale that up for nationwide coverage.
  Many of the code snippets are based heavily on ChatGPT with modifications that were done to fix some miscommunications.
  Any feedback is welcome, i am at the very beging of my coding journey and hope to continously update this project.
  Lastly there isnt much i can do to put my "Stank" on this so i named the project FMG ("Fardal Muineal Garbh")
  Supposedly its Irish for "Rough Neck Inventory", Roughnecks being based on "Razaks Roughnecks" since i work in pest control.
